## Alarms

Alarms clocks are defaulty implemented in Gladys. 

By default, an alarm does nothing. You need to create a scenario which is triggered by a specific alarm ( or any alarm ) to do something on Alarm.

We will assume in this tutorial that you have created a scenario before.

### Go to Alarms

In your Gladys dashboard, go directly to the `Alarm` panel.

### Click on create

You can define three types of alarms :  

- One time alarm at a specific datetime
- Alarm in X hours (useful for a quick nap, or a 8 hour sleep )
- Recurring alarm (each Monday at xx )

Create your alarm, and...

### That's it !

Don't forget that you need to create a scenario. If you don't create a scenario, you will just get a little message in Gladys log, nothing more.
